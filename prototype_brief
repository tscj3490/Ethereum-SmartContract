Prototype Stage 1:

1. Build smart contracts to satisfy user stories described in prototype document:

User A - stories
* I want to have an artist profile that links me to my audio files
* I want to be able to upload my audio samples from WAV format
* I want my Audio sample to have a title and a unique code
* I want to see my audio file in the browser
* I want to be able to upload a completed track and a selection of ‘stems’ (the part that make up the track) 

User B - stories
* I want to browse for new sounds that I can use to make music
* I want to ‘create a new project’ and save sounds to a shortlist 
* I want to download the sounds i have saved 
* I want to upload a finished track to my ‘project’ using the stems from User A, along with WAVs of my own
* I will be assigned a unique ID for my new track
* I want to system to know which stems i used 

 2. Test contracts
3. Deploy
4. Integrate to frontend part - Web3
